# Exodus Logistics Website
# Projection Description 
The projet highlights a website created for a small shipping company based in Atlanta, Georgia. They needed a simple website that grabs
 
 attention and pushes customers into their email inbox. I tried a  very simplistic approach with the use of isometric 3d images to make 
 
 things a little more interesting. For now the business is closed but the website will stil be up to showcase my skills.
